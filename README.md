# Backend Test

## Scenario

üî• Welcome !

You have just been recruited by Bunji as a Backend Engineer.
In order for the sales team to sign a deal with the biggest real estate network of France, we have been asked to
synchronize events between Bunji app and their Google calendar (two way sync).

You voluntered to be the Lead Dev on this task

## üéØ Goal

The goal is to be able to create a simplified two way calendar sync between :

- our dummy Bunji event app
- a dummy simplfied Google Calendar API

The idea is to be able to test your :

- technical skills
- code quality

## üóÇÔ∏è Guidelines

- You should use the Bunji dummy Node.js app as a starting Point (this repo)
- you are free to add any library you deem necessary
- here is the documentation for the dummy google calendar dummy api (it is protected by api token) : https://github.com/chrisbag/google-events-dummy
- bear in mind that the bunji and google events models are slightly different
- to simplify approach, ignore timzeones
- feel free to add any required fields to the Bunji event or user models but do not modify existing fields
- events will have to be associated to the correct users.
- you are free to refactor, modify the project structure accordingly
- please add any relevant documentation
- no need to add any kind of database
- you can add tests wherever if might think it necessary (not compulsory but appreciated)
